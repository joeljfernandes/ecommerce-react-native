This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).


## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```


2. Start the app (choose your platform: iOS, Android, or Web)

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

   To preview on the web, press `w` in the Expo CLI or run:

   ```bash
   npx expo start --web
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo


You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).


## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.


## Why this repo?

I use this repository to:

- Try out the latest React Native and Expo features
- Explore new Expo SDK releases
- Test best practices and patterns
- Quickly prototype UI/UX ideas
